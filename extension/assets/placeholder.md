# Icon Placeholders

For development, you'll need to create the following icon files in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16×16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32×32 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48×48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128×128 pixels

You can create these as simple colored squares with text labels for initial development.

Final icons will be provided by the product owner (as mentioned in the PRD).
